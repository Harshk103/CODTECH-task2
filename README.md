Overview of Task-01: Designing a student grade tracker.

The code reads basic information from the user like name of the student and his marks in 3 theory and practical subjects.
The code calculates the average marks using double data type as it may be a decimal value. 
Then, this average value is used to calculate the grade of the student as per the following grading system:-
avg > 95% --> A+
85% <= avg < 95% --> A
80% <= avg < 85% --> B+
75% <= avg < 80% --> B
70% <= avg < 75% --> C+
60% <= avg < 70% --> C
40% <= avg < 60% --> D
avg < 40% --> Fail
